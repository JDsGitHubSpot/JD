<h3>Who Runs This Blog?</h3>

<p>This is my blog in that my body has control over its contents. However, what has control over my body is another question, and it might be that I am not the primary actor in regards to anything I do, nor primary keeper of anything I own, and that other powers are acting and owning. I, in this sense, am the thing that misidentifies with this power, and that is at least the thing which has this blog.</p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>

<p>I do recognize, however, that even if I am misidentifying with that which is not me, there is something to say that I am the only one that can rightfully do so. It just so happens that I am conscious of this body in particular, at least some of the time. So, if anyone claimed to also be me, then all I could say is we are one and you are not conscious of your body or of my body, but of our body. Of course, most of the time no one misidentifies with my body except for myself, so I don't need to share, and I can safely call this blog mine and mine alone.</p>
