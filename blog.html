<h3>This BLOG</h3>

<p>This blog is mostly concerned with confusion. What is confusion? Are we confused? Why are or aren't we confused? Could we be confused and not know it? Is confusion necessary for us? How does confusion effect us? Am I being confusing? </p>

<h3>Be Concerned With CONFUSION</h3>

<p>We should be concerned with confusion, because we are often confused and don't know what to do about it. If we can identify that we are confused and why, then maybe we can lessen our confusion. This may sound obvious, but most things are obvious once you realize them, and many things that are obvious are also wrong. This is to say that somethings obviousness does not make it trivial. In fact, the hardest part about obviousness is that it blinds us from our confusion, since we don’t investigate what is obvious and things that are obvious can be wrong. How do we distinguish between what is obvious because it is true, and what we believe because we think it is obvious? </p>

<h3>Thought Experiment Form EVOLUTION</h3>

<p> Think of our evolution from a roiling solution of amino acids to a primordial slime to humans. It was very hard, for us as a living system, to evolve enough that we could be confused. For example, the chemicals we evolved from cannot be confused since they cannot have beliefs, and, therefore, they don’t contend with any contradictions. Same is true for many animate and inanimate things, such as rocks or single celled organisms. If you are a rock you cannot be confused. What is it that we have that rocks don’t which allow us to be confused? That is to ask, what is sufficient for confusion in humans?</p>

<h3>Listen To ME</h3>

<p>Should barbers have nice haircuts? Should those that play well coach? Are those who write self help books the ones that can best help themselves? If you are good at something naturally, meaning without effort or trying, you have less incentive or ability to understand why you are so. For example, if you are naturally happy, then what incentive do you have to understand happiness, and what knowledge do you have of what actions lead from unhappiness to happiness? Those that are happy for reasons that are not effortful do not easily know the cause of their happiness. Those that are not naturally happy but came to be happy do to their effort, at least know what their effort consisted of. And, those that are unhappy but never learn how to be happy are worst off. </p>

<p>I can imagine, however, that someone who is naturally happy can try to be unhappy, and, if they succeed and then succeed to return to happiness, that they might learn about what it means to be happy more than any other. I believe this, because they both know what is sufficient to become unhappy and to become happy.</p>

<p>What am I saying? Am I the latter description, but for confusion in place of unhappiness? Yes. When I was young, I was naturally unconfused. As I grew, I became confused through effort and trying, deeply confused. Now, through effort and trying, I am beginning to become unconfused. This is the content of this blog, a process of b e c o m i n gU N C O N F U S E D.</p>
